## Problem Statement
Implement the operation defined by the following matrix $A$ on a quantum circuit $\mathrm{qc}$ with $1$ qubit.

$$
A = \ket{1}\bra{0}+\ket{0}\bra{1}
$$

## Constraints
- **In this problem, the state with different <Link href={pagePathEn.qa + "#global"}>global phase</Link> will not be considered correct.**
- The submitted code must follow the specified format:

    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit


    def solve() -> QuantumCircuit:
        qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
        # Write your code here:

        return qc
