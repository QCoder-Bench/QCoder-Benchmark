## Problem Statement
You are given an integer $n$.
Implement the operation defined by the following matrix $A$ on a quantum circuit $\mathrm{qc}$ with $n$ qubits:

$$
A = 2 \ket{0} \bra{0} - I
$$

where $I$ denotes the $2^n \times 2^n$ identity matrix.

## Constraints
- $2 \leq n \leq 10$
- Global phase is ignored in judge.
- The submitted code must follow the specified format:

    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit


    def solve(n: int) -> QuantumCircuit:
        qc = QuantumCircuit(n)
        # Write your code here:

        return qc

## Sample Input
- $n=2$:
The matrix $A$ is calculated as follows.
$$
A = 2 \ket{00} \bra{00} - I =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & -1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & -1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
