## Problem Statement
You are given a real number $\theta$.
Implement the operation of preparing the state $\ket{\psi}$ from the zero state on a quantum circuit $\mathrm{qc}$ with $1$ qubit.

The quantum state $\ket{\psi}$ is defined as
$$
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi} = e^{i\theta}\ket{0} \nonumber
\end{equation}.
$$

## Constraints
- $0 \leq \theta < 2\pi$
- **In this problem, the state with different global phase will not be considered correct.**
- The submitted code must follow the specified format:

    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

    def solve(theta: float) -> QuantumCircuit:
        qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
        # Write your code here:

        return qc
