## Problem Statement
Implement a $1$-qubit quantum circuit $\mathrm{qc}$ which satisfies the following condition:

- Given the zero state $\ket{0}$ as the input, return the minus state $\ket{-}$ as the output.

$$
\ket{0} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{qc}} \ket{-}
$$

Here, the minus state $\ket{-}$ is defined as

$$
\begin{equation}
\ket{-} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{0} - \ket{1}). \nonumber
\end{equation}
$$

## Constraints
- Global phase is ignored in judge.
- The submitted code must follow the specified format:

    '''python
    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit


    def solve() -> QuantumCircuit:
        qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
        # Write your code here:

        return qc
