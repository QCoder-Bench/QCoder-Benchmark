## Problem Statement
Implement the operation of preparing the state $\ket{\psi}$ from the zero state on a quantum circuit $\mathrm{qc}$ with $3$ qubits.

The state $\ket{\psi}$ is defined as

$$
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \lparen \ket{100} + \ket{010} + \ket{001} \rparen \nonumber
\end{equation}.
$$

## Constraints
- Global phase is ignored in judge.
- The submitted code must follow the specified format:

    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit


    def solve() -> QuantumCircuit:
        qc = QuantumCircuit(3)
        # Write your code here:

        return qc
