## Problem Statement
Implement the operation of preparing the plus state $\ket{+}$ from the zero state on a quantum circuit $\mathrm{qc}$ with $1$ qubit.

The plus state $\ket{+}$ is defined as

\begin{equation}
\ket{+} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{0} + \ket{1}). \nonumber
\end{equation}

## Constraints
- Global phase is ignored in judge.
- The submitted code must follow the specified format:

    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

    def solve() -> QuantumCircuit:
        qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
        # Write your code here:

        return qc
