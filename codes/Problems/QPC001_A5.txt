## Problem Statement
Implement the operation of preparing the state $\ket{\psi}$ from the zero state on a quantum circuit $\mathrm{qc}$ with $2$ qubits.

The state $\ket{\psi}$ is defined as

\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} (\ket{00} + \ket{10} + \ket{01}). \nonumber
\end{equation}

## Constraints
- Global phase is ignored in judge.
- The submitted code must follow the specified format:

'''python
    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

    def solve() -> QuantumCircuit:
        qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
        # Write your code here:

        return qc
