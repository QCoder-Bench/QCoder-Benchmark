## Problem Statement
Implement the operation of preparing the state $\ket{\psi}$ from the zero state on a quantum circuit $\mathrm{qc}$ with $2$ qubits.

The state $\ket{\psi}$ is defined as

\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi} = a_0\ket{00} + a_1\ket{10} + a_2\ket{01}, \nonumber
\end{equation}

where $a_0$, $a_1$, and $a_2$ denote arbitrary non-zero probability amplitudes (any values are permitted).

## Constraints
- Global phase is ignored in judge.
- The submitted code must follow the specified format:

'''python
    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

    def solve() -> QuantumCircuit:
        qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
        # Write your code here:

        return qc
