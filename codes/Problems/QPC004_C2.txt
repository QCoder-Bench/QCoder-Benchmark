## Problem Statement
You are given two positive integers $a$ and $L$ that are coprime.

Calculate $a^{-1}\ \text{mod}\ L$, where $a^{-1}$ is a inverse of $a$ and is defined as an integer that satisfies $a \cdot a^{-1} \equiv 1\ (\text{mod}\ L)$.

## Constraints
- $1 \leq a < L \leq 2^{1024}$
- **The result must be returned as a integer variable**
- The submitted code must follow the specified format:

    def solve(a: int, L: int) -> int:
        result: int = 0
        # Write your code here:

        return result
